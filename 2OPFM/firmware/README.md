I will eventually put detailed import and build instructions up, but for now: 

1: Import the project to STM32CubeIDE

2: Make sure optimization is set to "For Speed" 

3: Build and run it! 

These obviously assume familiarity with the process. 
If you are not and have questions about how to get it rolling, please don't hesitate to reach out (but google first!) 

You may notice that this code is organized poorly, and I may agree, but instead of doing a song and dance to provide
something especially clean, I wanted to share what the 2OPFM module really is and how it does its thang.
